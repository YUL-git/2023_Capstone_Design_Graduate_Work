## Dataset Overview
![overview image](./figures/data_overview.png)  
We train and evaluate our model using the dataset from [Outlier detection of Air Compressor](https://aifactory.space/competition/data/2226)

we assume that you have downloaded it and placed based on File Structure, inside the dataset folder.

## Submission Process  
Run All code in 'AE_ABOD.ipynb' to classify abnomalies of air compressor
